Closes #[issue-number]"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

#### Option A: Via Web Interface
1. Go to your Hugging Face Space
2. Click "Files" tab
3. Upload/Update these files:
   - `requirements.txt` (CRITICAL - updated versions)
   - `utils/compatibility.py` (NEW)
   - `app.py` (updated)
   - `credibility_analyzer/credibility_analyzer.py` (updated)
   - `utils/model_loader.py` (updated)
4. Wait for automatic rebuild

#### Option B: Via Git
```bash
# Clone your Hugging Face Space
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
cd YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# Copy updated files
cp -r "d:\ML Projects\FND\utils" .
cp "d:\ML Projects\FND\requirements.txt" .
cp "d:\ML Projects\FND\app.py" .
cp -r "d:\ML Projects\FND\credibility_analyzer" .

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix compatibility issues for deployment"
git push
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Watch the build logs in Hugging Face Spaces for these messages:

#### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
```
üîç Loading Credibility Analyzer models...
‚úÖ SVM model loaded
‚úÖ LSTM model loaded
‚úÖ BERT model loaded
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs (Still OK)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è SVM model loading failed: [error]
‚úÖ LSTM model loaded
‚úÖ BERT model loaded
System will continue with 2/3 models
```

#### ‚ùå Failure Signs (Need Action)
```
‚ùå All models failed to load
‚ùå Critical dependency missing
```

## Post-Deployment Verification (Within 5 Minutes)

### 1. Check App Loads
- Visit your Hugging Face Space URL
- Verify app loads without errors
- Check console for any warnings

### 2. Test Model Loading
- Look for model loading status messages in UI
- Should see "‚úÖ Models loaded successfully"
- If only 2/3 models loaded, that's acceptable

### 3. Test Predictions
Use these test inputs:

**Test 1: Real News**
```
Reuters reports that the Federal Reserve announced new interest rate policies today after careful economic analysis.
```
Expected: REAL (high confidence 90%+)

**Test 2: Fake News**
```
BREAKING!!! You WON'T believe what scientists discovered! Doctors HATE this one weird trick! Click here NOW!!!
```
Expected: FAKE (high confidence 90%+)

### 4. Check Performance
- Prediction time should be <2 seconds
- Memory usage should be stable
- No crashes or timeouts

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Models Don't Load

1. **Check Build Logs**
   ```
   Look for specific error messages in Hugging Face build logs
   ```

2. **Verify Requirements**
   ```bash
   # In Hugging Face terminal
   pip list | grep -E "numpy|tensorflow|torch|transformers"
   ```

3. **Run Environment Check**
   ```bash
   python verify_environment.py
   ```

4. **Check Model Files**
   ```bash
   ls -lh models/
   # Should show all .pkl and .h5 files
   ```

### If Predictions Fail

1. **Check Model Status**
   - Look at model loading messages
   - Verify at least one model loaded

2. **Test Individual Models**
   - Try prediction with just one model
   - Check if specific model causing issue

3. **Review Error Messages**
   - Check Streamlit logs
   - Look for stack traces

### Common Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| numpy._core error | Compatibility layer should auto-fix this |
| batch_shape error | safe_load_keras_model handles this |
| accelerate error | requirements.txt includes accelerate now |
| Out of memory | Reduce batch size or use fewer models |
| Model not found | Verify model files uploaded correctly |

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If deployment fails completely:

1. **Revert to Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

2. **Or Restore Files Manually**
   - Revert `requirements.txt`
   - Remove `utils/compatibility.py`
   - Revert `app.py`, `credibility_analyzer.py`, `model_loader.py`

3. **Notify Users**
   - Add maintenance banner
   - Provide estimated fix time
